## 2. How to run the jupyter notebook containing this project 
At [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) website download and install the 'Individual Edition' to gain access to all of the relevant software.

Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project. The name, Jupyter, comes from the programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.<br>
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.<br>

In order to install: On the command line, $ pip install jupyter<br>
After intall, on terminal, type the command: $ jupyter notebook<br>
Jupyter will initialise in the background and your default browser will pop up in a new tab connecting to webserver.<br> http://localhost:8888/tree<br>
The terminal will simultaneously display instructions on how to stop the connection to that webserver in addition to URL details that <br>contain a unique token.<br>

http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXYYYYY123456789<br>
Chrome and firefox are the optimal web browsers to use and you may need to copy the url into one of these instead of using the default<br> pop-up.<br>
You are running the Jupyter server and can use it to open and engage with my repository contents.<br>
