## Plan for Tasks 2020 Assessment based on the marking scheme
Intial Steps: Creategithub repository, create notebook, prepare project plan.<br>
Research: Investigation of the topics.  Submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature; evidence of understanding<br>
of the documentation for any software or libraries used.<br>
Development: Clear, clean well-written, and efficient code with appropriate comments.<br>
Environment can be set up as described; code works without tweaking and as described;  evidence of consideration<br>
of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind.<br>
Consistency: Evidence of planning and project management; pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by commit history.<br>
Documentation: Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare<br>
the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expect upon running the code. Concise descriptions<br>
of code in comments and README.<br>
Conclusion: Summarise findings of the analysis.<br>

## 3. How to run the jupyter notebook containing this project 
Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project. The name, Jupyter, comes from the programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.<br>
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.<br>
In order to install: On the command line, $ pip install jupyter<br>
After intall, on terminal, type the command: $ jupyter notebook<br>
Jupyter will initialise in the background and your default browser will pop up in a new tab connecting to webserver.<br> http://localhost:8888/tree<br>
The terminal will simultaneously display instructions on how to stop the connection to that webserver in addition to URL details that <br>contain a unique token.<br>

http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXYYYYY123456789<br>
Chrome and firefox are the optimal web browsers to use and you may need to copy the url into one of these instead of using the default<br> pop-up.<br>
You are running the Jupyter server and can use it to open and engage with my repository contents.<br>
